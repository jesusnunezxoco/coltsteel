# Big O

## 10 - Space Complexity

Focusing on auxillary space complexity, the amount of space an algorithm takes

- Most primitives are O(1)
- String are O(n) of space where n is the length of the string
- Reference types like arrays or objects are O(n), depending amount of elements and properties respectively

## 11 - Logarithms

- log2(8) = 3 ==> 2^3 = 8
- log2(value) = exponent ==> 2^exponent = value
- Certain search algorithms have logs, especially the more efficient ones
- recursion sometimes involve log space complexity
